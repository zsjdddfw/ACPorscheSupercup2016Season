# ACPorscheSupercup2016Season
Assetto Corsa Porsche Supercup 2016 Season Custom Championship mod

## Mod Info
This custom championship mod is created by Shijie "St3fan" Zhang for racing simulator Assetto Corsa to provide a genuine Porsche Supercup 2016 season experience.

## Features
* Real drivers' names, real drivers' nationalities, and real race cars' liveries.
* Actual historical weather, and actual historical temperatures from weather records on race day.
* Full-length race, realistic practice and qualifying sessions length.
* Round 1 Catalunya, Round 3 Spielberg, Round 4 Silverstone, [Round 6 Hockenheim](http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/hockenheimring-multi-layout.7223/), Round 7 Spa, Round 8 Monza are currently included. More to come in future updates.
* Actual real racing photos as thumbnails.

## Current To-do List
* Use [gbw weather](http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/good-and-bad-weathers.11194/).
* Use OSRW layouts for larger grid (Current 24-car grid is already quite heavy on CPU on my E3-1230v3, so more testing will be done before OSRW layouts are added).
* Add more tracks to the career mode and complete the experience. Due to the [Hungaroring track on RaceDepartment](http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/hungaroring.2577/) being broken for offline racing, planned update to add Hungaroring is temporarily halted.
* Make multiple versions for people who prefer stock weather vs gbw weather, large grid vs small grid, and different versions of mods.
* Adjust AI for individual drivers to best match their performance during the season (huge project, will take some more time).
