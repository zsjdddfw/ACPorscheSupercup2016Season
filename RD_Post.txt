[B]Current to-do list:[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Use [URL='http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/good-and-bad-weathers.11194/']gbw weather[/URL].
[*]Use OSRW layouts for larger grid (Current 24-car grid is already quite heavy on CPU on my E3-1230v3, so more testing will be done before OSRW layouts are added).
[*]Add more tracks to the career mode and complete the experience. Due to the [URL='http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/hungaroring.2577/']Hungaroring track on RaceDepartment[/URL] being broken for offline racing, planned update to add Hungaroring is temporarily halted.
[*]Make multiple versions for people who prefer stock weather vs gbw weather, large grid vs small grid, and different versions of mods.
[*]Adjust AI for individual drivers to best match their performance during the season (huge project, will take some more time).
